  What_is_CBD: `What is CBD?`,
  What_is_CBD_ANS: `The abbreviation "CBD" comes from the term "cannabidiol". It is a
  molecule that is one of many (around 100) cannabinoids present in hemp,
  also called cannabis sativa. CBD has a large number of benefits for
  improving well-being: sleep, relaxation, pain management.`,
  Are_hemp_and_CBD_legal: `Are hemp and CBD legal?`,
  Are_hemp_and_CBD_legal_ANS: `The answer is yes. It is not obvious to the eye to tell the difference between
  a legal and illegal product, because the plants come from the same
  species. What allows you to know if your product is legal or not, it is the
  rate of THC. Indeed, only a rate below 0,3%, fixed by the European
  regulation, allows to assure the legality. For processed products, such as
  cosmetics, the rate is 0% THC. The WHO ensures the legality of hemp,
  because it does not cause psychotropic effects.`,
  Can_flowers_be_smoked: `Can flowers be smoked?`,
  Can_flowers_be_smoked_ANS: `The flowers should not be smoked. It is advisable to consume them either
  in infusions with a fatty substance. Indeed, hemp is not water-soluble. It is
  also possible to integrate them in your recipes.`,
  What_is_the_difference_between_hemp_CBD_and_cannabis: `What is the difference between hemp (CBD) and cannabis?`,
  What_is_the_difference_between_hemp_CBD_and_cannabis_ANS: `The "cannabis" family is composed of several varieties, including
  Marijuana, which has the particularity of having psychotropic effects
  (recreational cannabis). Hemp is another variety. Its difference is that it
  has only 0.3% THC. Thus, it has no psychoactive effect, contrary to the first
  variety mentioned. Thanks to this low THC content, hemp is legal, unlike
  the first mentioned variety.`,
  How_to_use_hemp_oil: `How to use hemp oil?`,
  How_to_use_hemp_oil_ANS: `To use hemp oil, it can be added to food or to a drink. What we
  recommend and what brings a more important efficiency is to put the
  drops under the tongue. The sublingual action allows a more important
  and faster effect thanks to the numerous blood vessels present in this part
  of the mouth.`,
  How_to_use_hemp_pollen: `How to use hemp pollen?`,
  How_to_use_hemp_pollen_ANS: `Hemp pollen, also called resin, can be used in two different ways: \n in infusion: let it infuse for 10 minutes with a fatty substance such as oil or

  water-soluble. \n In cooking: to integrate in your best recipes.`,
