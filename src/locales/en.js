  What_is_CBD: `What is CBD?`,
  What_is_CBD_ANS: `The abbreviation "CBD" comes from the term "cannabidiol". It is a
  molecule that is one of many (around 100) cannabinoids present in hemp,
  also called cannabis sativa. CBD has a large number of benefits for
  improving well-being: sleep, relaxation, pain management.`,
  Are_hemp_and_CBD_legal: `Are hemp and CBD legal?`,
  Are_hemp_and_CBD_legal_ANS: `The answer is yes. It is not obvious to the eye to tell the difference between
  a legal and illegal product, because the plants come from the same
  species. What allows you to know if your product is legal or not, it is the
  rate of THC. Indeed, only a rate below 0,3%, fixed by the European
  regulation, allows to assure the legality. For processed products, such as
  cosmetics, the rate is 0% THC. The WHO ensures the legality of hemp,
  because it does not cause psychotropic effects.`,
  Can_flowers_be_smoked: `Can flowers be smoked?`,
  Can_flowers_be_smoked_ANS: `The flowers should not be smoked. It is advisable to consume them either
  in infusions with a fatty substance. Indeed, hemp is not water-soluble. It is
  also possible to integrate them in your recipes.`,
  What_is_the_difference_between_hemp_CBD_and_cannabis: `What is the difference between hemp (CBD) and cannabis?`,
  What_is_the_difference_between_hemp_CBD_and_cannabis_ANS: `The "cannabis" family is composed of several varieties, including
  Marijuana, which has the particularity of having psychotropic effects
  (recreational cannabis). Hemp is another variety. Its difference is that it
  has only 0.3% THC. Thus, it has no psychoactive effect, contrary to the first
  variety mentioned. Thanks to this low THC content, hemp is legal, unlike
  the first mentioned variety.`,
  How_to_use_hemp_oil: `How to use hemp oil?`,
  How_to_use_hemp_oil_ANS: `To use hemp oil, it can be added to food or to a drink. What we
  recommend and what brings a more important efficiency is to put the
  drops under the tongue. The sublingual action allows a more important
  and faster effect thanks to the numerous blood vessels present in this part
  of the mouth.`,
  How_to_use_hemp_pollen: `How to use hemp pollen?`,
  How_to_use_hemp_pollen_ANS: `Hemp pollen, also called resin, can be used in two different ways: \n in infusion: let it infuse for 10 minutes with a fatty substance such as oil or
  soy milk. This allows the dissolution of hemp which in its usual state is not
  water-soluble. \n In cooking: to integrate in your best recipes.`,
  How_to_use_hemp_rock: `How to use hemp rock?`,
  How_to_use_hemp_rock_ANS: `Hemp rock can be used in two different ways: \n\n  In infusion: let it infuse for 10 minutes with a fatty substance such as oil or

  water-soluble \n In cooking: to integrate in your best recipes.`,

    hypopharynx; the two palatine tonsils are located on either side of the oropharynx; the pharyngeal tonsil is located on the posterior
    wall of the nasopharynx. The enlargement of the pharyngeal tonsil constitutes the adenoids).`,
  Classic_Bud: `Classic Bud`,
  Classic_Bud_CONTENT: `These are the top parts of hemp (flowers) available in whole.`,
  Cannabis_Sativa: `Cannabis Sativa`,
  Cannabis_Sativa_CONTENT: `Cannabis Sativa" is the scientific name for hemp. It is one of the two main species of Cannabinaceae, one of which has psychotropic
  effects (commonly called "recreational cannabis") and the other one does not have psychotropic effects (commonly called hemp or
  CBD, although the latter is a misnomer).`,
  CBD: `CBD`,
  CBD_CONTENT: `The formula "CBD" is the abbreviation of the term "cannabidiol". This molecule is one of the many (around two hundred)
  cannabinoids present in hemp, also called cannabis sativa.`,
  Super_Critical_CO2: `Super Critical CO2`,
  Super_Critical_CO2_CONTENT: `This is the extraction technique used for hemp-based products. It allows to obtain a compound by preserving all its integrity and to
  take full advantage of its own qualities.`,
  Cortisol: `Cortisol`,
  Cortisol_CONTENT: `Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It plays an essential role in balancing blood glucose and releasing sugar from
  the body's stores in response to increased energy demands. Cortisol is also involved in the metabolism of fats and proteins.`,
  Surrounding_effect: `Surrounding effect`,
  Surrounding_effect_CONTENT: `CBD is one of the molecules that are present in hemp. Only, it is not alone. It is a molecule that needs the surrounding effect to be
  activated: that is to say that it can be totally effective only when it is accompanied by all the molecules of the hemp plant.`,
  Hemp_flower: `Hemp flower`,
  Hemp_flower_CONTENT: `The hemp flower is the top part harvested from the hemp plant. It is then used dried or in the form of oil.`,
  Full_spectrum: `Full spectrum`,
  Full_spectrum_CONTENT: `While isolate is defined as a pure CBD product, meaning it contains only CBD, and no other cannabis components, Full Spectrum
  hemp is an extract that includes all the cannabinoids present in the cannabis plant. This allows for the surrounding effect and full
  effectiveness of CBD.`,

  MCT_Oil: `MCT Oil`,
  MCT_Oil_CONTENT: `It is the oily base associated with hemp oil. Its interest compared to a classic oil, found in other products (e.g. coconut, rapeseed or
    sunflower oil), is that its digestion does not require the action of the pancreas or the gallbladder. Its absorption then takes place very
    high in the intestine. This allows a better assimilation by the body. Indeed, the body is largely composed of water. As oil and water do
    not mix, it is necessary to ensure good absorption. MCT oil allows this.`,
  Indoor: `Indoor`,
  Indoor_CONTENT: `This means that the plants were harvested under greenhouses. The interest of this mode of culture is that the greenhouses allow the
  management of heat, humidity and light. The lighting system also allows to manage the height of the plant because it stops growing
  once it reaches the light. This guarantees the quality of each flower grown.`,
  Isolate: `Isolate`,
  Isolate_CONTENT: `An isolate is a product where there is only the CBD molecule. There is not the complete spectrum of hemp. The effectiveness is
  therefore less, because of the absence of the effect of surrounding.`,
